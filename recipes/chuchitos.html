    <h2>What Are Chuchitos?</h2>
    <p>Chuchitos are small Guatemalan tamales made with corn dough. They are stuffed with chicken or pork in a tomato-based sauce called recado. 
        They are smaller than the Guatemalan tamal colorado and are wrapped in corn husks instead of banana leaves. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        </li>
        <li>Salt and powdered chicken bouillon to taste
        </li>
     </ul>
     <h4>For The Dough (Masa):
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs. of instant corn flour
        </li>
        <li>2 Sticks of butter, softened
        </li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons of vegetable oil
        </li>
        <li>Salt and powdered chicken bouillon to taste
        </li>
        <li>1 lb. of Tusa (dried corn husks)
        </li>
        <li>Water
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>How To Make The Recado (Sauce):
    </h4>
     <ol>
        <li>On a skillet or comal, roast the guaque and sambo peppers. Once roasted, place the peppers in a bowl filled with water for about 20 minutes to reduce their spiciness. </li>
        <li>Get rid of the water and blend the peppers until smooth. If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of fresh water. Pass it through a strainer to remove any seeds. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Use the skillet again to roast the tomatoes, miltomates (tomatillos), garlic, onion, and red peppers. Then, blend until well combined and strain everything to make a rich sauce. </li>
        <li>In a pot, pour the tomato sauce, add the pepper mixture to the sauce, and bring to a boil. If the sauce is too thin, add two tablespoons of corn flour and stir until thickened. </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Chicken Meat Filling:
    </h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the chicken into small pieces and add them to a pot with little water. Boil the meat until cooked (about 10 minutes), seasoning with a pinch of salt and chicken bouillon.</li>
            <li>Drain the water and set the chicken aside for assembling.
            </li>
        </ol>
    <h4>Time To Prepare The Dough:
    </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the dough by mixing the corn flour with water, careful not to use too much water. It is best to add half a cup of water at a time until the batter has reached the desired consistency. </li>
        <li>Add the oil, butter, salt, and chicken bouillon to taste, mixing it with your hands until you get a smooth dough (it should have a soft consistency). </li>
        <li>Cover the dough with a clean, damp cloth to avoid dryness.  
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>How To Assemble A Chuchito:
    </h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the corn husks in hot water (not boiling) for about an hour. Double-check that the husks are completely submerged so they become flexible and easy to fold.</li>
            <li>Place a large spoonful of dough in the center of each tusa (husk). Then make a hole in the middle of the dough with a small spoon. Place a piece of cooked chicken in the center, and pour recado sauce on top.</li>
            <li>Using the same spoon, cover the hole with the dough you placed first. Fold the husk towards the center and upwards, tying with a strap (cut a few strips from a single sheet of the husk as straps to fasten all the wrappings).</li>
            <li>The dough must be well wrapped. If needed, fold an additional piece of husk before tying it. Repeat until all the dough is stuffed and wrapped up.</li>
            <li>In a large steam pot, place the chuchitos with the tied side up. Add enough water to steam them (a couple of inches is enough) and cover with a lid. Cook on low for about 30-60 minutes, checking the water level every 10 minutes or so. </li>
            <li>The dish is ready when the dough is soft and quickly pulls away from the husks. Serve them with a bit of recado (sauce) and a sprinkle of grated cheese on top.</li>
        </ol>
