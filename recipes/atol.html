    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 medium-size yellow corn cobs (about 2 cups of kernels)</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups of cold water</li>
        <li>2 cups of whole milk
        </li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick
        </li>
        <li>1 cup of sugar
        </li> 
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt
        </li>  
        <li>Ground cinnamon for garnish (optional)
        </li>  
        <li>¼ cup of cooked corn kernels for garnish (optional)
        </li>  
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
     <ol>
        <li>Peel and wash the ears of corn thoroughly and cut the kernels off. Put them and their juices aside. Throw away the cobs. </li>
        <li>Put the kernels and about 1 cup of water on a high-powered blender and blend until they are coarsely grounded. Add the rest of the water and keep blending until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour the kernel mixture onto a large pot, add milk, cinnamon stick, sugar, and salt. Bring to a low boil on medium-low heat for about 20 minutes. </li>
        <li>Stir constantly to avoid the mixture sticking to the bottom.
        </li>
        <li>Lower the heat and let it simmer for about 15 minutes until it thickens. Serve the atol warm and in cups, garnishing with a sprinkle of ground cinnamon, and top with a handful of cooked corn kernels.</li>
